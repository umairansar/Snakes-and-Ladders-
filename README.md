# Snakes-and-Ladders
A Project for 15-112 @ CMU-Q

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an online multiplayer game called Snakes & Ladder. The game (including the GUI) will be built from scratch using Python 3.7. 

### Description
Snakes & Ladders is an ancient Indian boardgame played widely today. The board has boxes numbered from 1 to 100. The game usually consists of atleast 2 players (but 4 players gameplay is common as well). These player get to choose unique colored tokens. The first person who reaches 100th box wins. Some boxes have ladders leading to higher numbered box (boosting the player's chances of winning) or have snakes leading back to the lowered number box (reducing the player's chances of winning). 
###### A demo of the board can be found [here](http://toytheater.com/wp-content/uploads/snakes_and_ladders.gif).

### Components
1. Game Boards - multiple board designs  
2. Multiplay - allows multiplayer gameplay  for (upto 4 players)
3. Dice - for players
4. Scoreboard - shows live scores and final scores at the end of the game
5. Online - allows both offline and online gameplay 
6. Animation - for the tokens and dice
7. Save Data - shows  most recent game scores (scoreboard) even after closing and reopening
8. Save Game - saves the game and allows resume 

### Deliverables 
- For first checkpoint, components 1 to 4 are expected to be completed.
- For final checkpoint, componenets 5 to 8 are expected to be implemented. 

##### Libraries: Tkinter, Random, Socket, and Numpy will be used for the development. More libraries will be added later as necessary.
